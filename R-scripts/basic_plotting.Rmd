## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
str(cars)
summary(cars)
```

# Lets see what means this data
lets plot the data to see it.
```{r}

plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)

```

## Find the regresion line

```{r}

plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
fit <- lm(cars$dist~cars$speed)

# task: find and document what abline does and what the pareameters mean
abline(fit$coeff, lwd=2)

```

## Add text

```{r}
plot.new()
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)

# calculate lineal model
fit <- lm(cars$dist~cars$speed)

# plot the line
abline(fit$coeff, lwd=2)

# get the numeric value
b = round(fit$coefficients,4)
text(5, 100, paste("y =", b[1], "+", b[2], "x"), adj=c(0,0.5))

rho <- round(cor(cars$speed,cars$dist),4)
text(5, 80,expression(paste(rho," = 0.8567")),adj=c(0,0.5))



```

## Add title fix axe names and Y limits to have intercept


```{r}
plot.new()

# calculate lineal model
fit <- lm(cars$dist~cars$speed)
intercept = fit$coeff[1]

plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, main="dist vs speed", xlab = "speed", ylab="dist", ylim=c(intercept,140))

# plot the line
abline(fit$coeff, lwd=2)

# get the numeric value
b = round(fit$coefficients,4)
text(5, 100, paste("y =", b[1], "+", b[2], "x"), adj=c(0,0.5))

rho <- round(cor(cars$speed,cars$dist),4)
text(5, 80,expression(paste(rho," = 0.8567")),adj=c(0,0.5))

```



## Paired


```{r}
set.seed(12201970)
before <- runif(6, 5, 8)
after <- rnorm(6, before*1.05, 2)
z <- rep(c(0,1), rep(6,2))
#mypar(1,2)
```

```{r}

boxplot(before,after,names=c("Before","After"),ylab="Response")
```

Seems That theres is an effect between before and after. What do you think?

Lets see how the pairs has been change:

```{r}

plot(z, c(before, after),
     xaxt="n", ylab="Response",
     xlab="", xlim=c(-0.5, 1.5))
axis(side=1, at=c(0,1), c("Before","After"))
segments(rep(0,6), before, rep(1,6), after, col=1)

```

## Paired plot summary

Could you comment what is the difference of plotting paired or not the data? Are you going to draw the same conclusions


# Bpmus: including Plots with no code

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Lets calculate the mean of "pressure"

```{r}

pm = mean(pressure)

```

Hummm, we have an error. It is pressure really what we think it is?

It is a vector?

lets see


```{r}

str(pressure)

```

NOP! it is a dataframe. It has two columns, temperature and pressure

```{r}

summary(pressure)

```
Question: look at the mean and median of pressure, what do you see?

```{r}

boxplot(pressure)

```
From the boxplot we see that is not a normal distribution. Is log, if we want to make a regression probably we would like to convert to lineal

```{r}
boxplot(log(pressure$pressure))

```

```{r}
plot(pressure$temperature, log(pressure$pressure, base = 2))
```

## Task: 

make to plots: 
* plot the regression line for the pressure$pressure raw 
* plot the regression line for the transformed pressure

make a variable logpress that holds log(pressure$pressure)
